# Oppinionated standards?

Yes! Years have gone by where countless learners have asked for guidance on platforms like StackOverflow on how to design their conventions regarding sequential databases. Answers can be simplified to "be consistent".

The result is that between languages, platforms or frameworks there is no 
- predictability
- compatability
- general abstraction

## Wouldn't it be great...

If creators, maintainers and collaborators would adhere to a common standard? What would that mean for the predictability of models and ultimately APIs? 

In a time where developers are open to coding standards within their languages (e.g. [PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/) ) and accept mechanisms to verify adherence (e.g. [prettier](https://prettier.io/) ), isn't it time to introduce the same for database design?

## Overcoming legacy

Surely such standards will take years to be adopted and will be "fought" by all players who have to take refactoring into consideration.
This is why a **Universal SQL Standard** has to be the result of the open source community where every standard is a result of discussion.

## Limitations

UTF-8 has simplified many concerns regarding encoding and collation, but due to our diverersive planet and its languages, standardization of encoding is still out of reach. However, standards for structure are more than overdue. 

## Invitation

We hereby urge all creators to join this organisation to provide input and be heard.
